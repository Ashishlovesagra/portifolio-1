          <h1>Context and Background</h1>
          <p>
            FAP (Find a Partner Program) is a program by Dell that enables End
            Customers, Other Partners and Dell Sales Makers to engage with
            Dell's certified partners to solve their technology implementation
            challenges. The program helps partners to grow their business and
            also drives revenue growth for Dell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dell was facing challenges in increasing customer engagement with
            its partners through the FAP program and driving revenue growth for
            both Dell and its partners. Google Analytics data also revealed that
            the average time spent on the FAP program website was low,
            indicating a lack of customer interest and engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these challenges, Dell decided to revamp the FAP program
            with a focus on improving the user experience and enhancing the
            visibility of Dell's product portfolio and the value proposition of
            the FAP program.

          <h1>What was the problem</h1>
          <div>
            The business challenge for Dell is to increase customer engagement
            with the FAP program and drive revenue growth for both Dell and its
            partners. This requires addressing the low traffic, poor user
            experience, and low conversion rates on the website.
          </div>
          <div>
            From a design perspective, the challenge is to create a
            user-friendly and visually appealing interface that simplifies the
            partner search process and enhances the visibility of Dell's product
            portfolio. This involves addressing pain points such as the poor
            user experience, high bounce rates, and low engagement.

            When we were on-boarded to Dell FAP project, Dell had already
            conducted user research. So we began by analysing and synthesising
            the user research data collected which involved reviewing the
            existing experience and identifying key insights, pain points, and
            opportunities for improvement.

            responsibilities, frustrations, and needs. Then, I proceeded to map

            </div>
            <div>
              Additionally, the configurable worksteps allow users to create a

              automatic closing features would significantly increase the
              efficiency of case resolution, reducing the time and effort
              required to close cases.
