          <h1>Context and Background</h1>
          <p>
            MoneyTap is a Bangalore-based fintech startup that provides users
            with an app-based credit line. The app allows users to borrow money
            on an as-needed basis, with low interest rates per month. MoneyTap
            has partnered with RBL Bank to provide credit lines to users, and
            the company has raised over $32 million in funding since its launch
            in 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            The credit approval process for MoneyTap users is handled through
            the MoneyTap Bankerâ€™s Portal (MTBP). This portal is used by
            MoneyTap's partner banks and other financial institutions to assess
            and approve user credit applications. However, the complex nature of
            the credit approval process and the large number of stakeholders
            involved has made the MTBP system difficult to use, resulting in
            frustration for users and slower processing times. As a result,
            there is a need to improve the user experience and streamline the
            credit approval process to meet the demands of MoneyTap's growing
            user base.
          </p>

          <h1>What was the problem</h1>
          <div>
            <div>
              MoneyTap Banker's Portal (MTBP) was a complex and unintuitive
              system that provides a poor user experience. The overabundance of
              functions and elements within the system make it challenging for
              users to navigate and learn how to use effectively.
            </div>
            <div>
              Additionally, the credit approval process is lengthy and
              inefficient due to multiple teams being involved in different
              stages of the process.
            </div>
            <div>
              Miscommunication and errors can occur due to a lack of
              communication and coordination between the teams involved. The
              system also requires manual data entry and verification, which can
              be prone to errors and slows down the credit approval process.

              The MTBP platform was created with the goal of delivering a
              seamless user experience with a simple, intuitive interface that
              priorities quick and efficient credit disbursement.
            </div>
            <div>
              To achieve this, I crafted a linear shared workspace with powerful
              user management capabilities that allow users to easily track the
              credit approval process from start to finish.
            </div>
            <div>
              As a key component of the design, data security was carefully
              considered and implemented to ensure that user data is kept safe
              at all times.

            <p>As part of my role in MTBP, I took on the responsibility of conducting comprehensive research to inform our product development strategy. To accomplish this, I drafted two research proposals, which included both secondary and primary research methods.</p>
            <p>Research Goal: The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a deep understanding of the credit approval process and our various users/teams involved in the process. By doing so, I was able to identify opportunities to differentiate our product, and to develop a product that met the needs and expectations of our users.</p>

                This increases productivity and reduces the time spent on

              Users can now close multiple cases at once, rather than
              individually, saving them valuable time. The bulk closing and
              automatic closing features would significantly increase the
              efficiency of case resolution, reducing the time and effort
              required to close cases.

            The preliminary testing indicates that the case management system's
            overall efficiency and user experience have improved significantly.
            Users have noted a decrease in administrative tasks, enhanced
            collaboration and communication, and more effective investigations.
            The following are some of the areas where the solution has had a
            substantial impact.

                    management process. The system now allows users to spend

              To ensure success in a project of this size, it is crucial for the

              If I had more time, I would definitely explore the possibilities
              of the "Trigger mechanism" even further. This mechanism plays an
              important role in automatically generating a case based on certain
              triggers, and I believe there is more room for innovation and
              improvement in this area.

              Additionally, I would like to add more flexibility to the system
              to accommodate cross-functional users whose goals may not be
              solely focused on case closure. By doing so, we can ensure that
              the system meets the needs of a wider range of users and can be
              used in various contexts.
