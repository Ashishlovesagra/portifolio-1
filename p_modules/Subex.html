            Subex wanted to revamp or reconstruct its case management (CM)
            system for several reasons, including outdated technology, limited
            functionality, poor user experience, and increased competition in
            the telecom industry.
          </p>
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3>What is a Case</h3>
              <p>
                A "Case" in Subex is a specific instance of fraudulent activity
                or revenue leakage that needs to be investigated and resolved.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if a customer is being charged for unused services,
                this could be identified as a case. Cases are managed through a
                case management module that includes features such as case
                assignment, prioritisation, notes, and closure.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Few Types of Cases</h3>
              <p>
                Revenue Leakage: This case type identifies instances where
                revenue is lost due to issues such as billing errors, system
                inefficiencies, or fraudulent activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fraud Detection: This case type involves subscription fraud or
                SIM box fraud, which can lead to significant revenue losses for
                telecom companies.

          <h1>Buisness Challenge</h1>
          <p>
            The outdated and limited functionality of the existing case
            management system has resulted in errors, missed revenue
            opportunities, and decreased competitiveness in the telecom
            industry, driving Subex to improve its case management capabilities
            to meet changing client needs.

            How might we provide users with more flexible and customisable case
            management workflows to proactively identify potential revenue
            leakage and fraudulent activities to increase user adoption and
            satisfaction?

          <h1>The Solution</h1>
          <p>
            We implemented a case timeline to enhance case visibility and
            streamline investigation. Additionally, we incorporated features
            such as bulk and automatic case closing, dashboard creation, and
            reporting tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our initial testing demonstrated a considerable enhancement in both
            user experience and system efficiency.

            started by identifying the different users engaged in revenue
            assurance and fraud management, and delved deeper into their roles,
            responsibilities, frustrations, and needs. Then, I proceeded to map
            the entire user journey to gain a comprehensive understanding of

            expressed the need for more automation, better visualization of

            </p>
            <p>
              By focusing on these areas, I was confident that I can create an

            Insights collect thought data available on Internet also suggested
            that there is a significant need for Subex to revamp their case
            management processes. The high costs of fraud losses and long case
            resolution times, pain points of data integration and the increasing
            importance of automation, all indicate the need for more efficient

            During our ideation session, we adopted a user-centric approach to
            define a new workflow for case management. Our aim was to create a
            simplified and streamlined process with an intuitive design that
            would increase the adoption of case management among both RA and FM

            solution that meets the needs of the users and addresses their pain

            would be optimal for the users while also meeting the business

              This means that each work-step is configurable in an overlay,

              Additionally, the configurable worksteps allow users to create a

            The preliminary testing indicates that the case management system's
            overall efficiency and user experience have improved significantly.
            Users have noted a decrease in administrative tasks, enhanced
            collaboration and communication, and more effective investigations.
            The following are some of the areas where the solution has had a
            substantial impact.

                  <div>
                    The streamlined workflows, automated features, and
                    collaboration tools have improved the efficiency of the case
                    management process. The system now allows users to spend
                    more time on investigative work rather than administrative
                    tasks.

                    The introduction of inline chat, shared workspaces, and a
                    shared repository has improved collaboration between team
                    members and departments, leading to more effective teamwork.

              To ensure success in a project of this size, it is crucial for the
              entire team to be involved throughout the process, sharing their
              research findings, discussing roadblocks, and working together
              towards achieving common goals that address both user needs and
              business objectives.

              Although we are still evaluating the results based on key

              positive impact on usability and user experience.

              Above all, this project provided me with the opportunity to work
              with a diverse user base in an unfamiliar industry, which has
              expanded my skills and knowledge as a designer.

              If I had more time, I would definitely explore the possibilities
              of the "Trigger mechanism" even further. This mechanism plays an
              important role in automatically generating a case based on certain
              triggers, and I believe there is more room for innovation and
              improvement in this area.

              Additionally, I would like to add more flexibility to the system
              to accommodate cross-functional users whose goals may not be
              solely focused on case closure. By doing so, we can ensure that
              the system meets the needs of a wider range of users and can be
              used in various contexts.
