          <h1>Context</h1>
          <p>
            Verizon is a multinational telecommunications company that offers
            wireless and internet services, as well as various products and
            services related to telecommunications and technology. The company
            is based in New York City and operates in over 150 countries
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sales & Ordering department plays a crucial role in Verizon's
            services that has more than 9.5K users.

          <h1>The Ask</h1>
          <div>
            To achieve, a common CPQ platform (Sale 360) that can be uses
            capabilities from multiple existing applications (Sales2GO, VISE,
            ProQuest) for different use cases.
          </div>
          <div>
            Create a more seamless and efficient user experience for the Sales
            and Ordering teams, as they will have a unified platform to access
            all relevant information and tools.
          </div>
          <div>
            The goal of modernizing the Sales & Ordering UX, the modernization
            effort will involve updating the design and functionality of the CPQ
            (Configure, Price, Quote) platform to align with current industry
            standards and user expectations, and ensure it is easy to use and
            accessible for all users.

          <div>
            <h5>Domain knowledge</h5>
            <p>
              The design team lacked a product expert or owner, resulting in
              more time being required to acquire the necessary domain knowledge
              to create effective designs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Documentation</h5>
            <p>
              There was a lack of requirements documentation at the beginning of
              the project, which made it difficult to define a feature list or
              document user stories.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Indefinite revisions</h5>
            <p>
              While design is an iterative process, there was no clear sign-off
              or approval process in place. This led to indefinite revisions and
              made it difficult to move forward with the project.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Access restrictions</h5>
            <p>
              Access to test environment tools were provided without a
              walkthrough or demo, and only video recordings were made
              available. This made it difficult for the design team to fully
              understand the capabilities of the tools and how to best utilize
              them.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>End-user engagement</h5>
            <p>
              There was little to no interaction with end-users throughout the
              project. The design team did not participate in any interviews or
              workshops with end-users, and pain points were only shared later
              in the process.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Technical constraints</h5>
            <p>
              The design team faced technical constraints related to the
              limitations of the toolset and platform. This made it difficult to
              create designs that fully met the needs of the end-users and were
              aligned with the product vision.

          <p>
            The research process began with analyzing and synthesizing the
            primary research insights provided by Verizon key stakeholders from
            business and technology teams. This involved reviewing the current
            experience study, data collected through interviews, and group
            discussions to identify user needs, pain points, and preferences, as
            well as business goals and constraints.

              <p>
                The new CPQ platform must address the diverse user needs of
                Sales Representatives, Order Managers, and Solution Architects
                by providing an intuitive, streamlined user experience that
                consolidates the functionality of Verizon's existing CPQ

                Design a unified CPQ platform that consolidates Proquest,
                Sales2Go, and ViSE into a seamless user experience, aiming to
                reduce quote generation times and increase sales revenue by 20%
                within the next year.

              <h4>Usability</h4>
              <p>
                Usability testing with Order Managers reveals that the current
                Proquest platform is difficult to navigate, and they often
                struggle to find the information they need to complete orders on
                time, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.

              <h4>Technical Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                Analysis of existing systems reveals that the new CPQ platform
                must be compatible with Verizon's existing CRM system to ensure
                that customer data is easily accessible and up-to-date.

          <h2>My Impact</h2>
          <p>
            I have made significant contributions to enhance the user experience
            and improve overall performance on the VZ360 project. To measure the
            success of the project, We have identified key UX KPIs and made
            predictions on how they will be impacted.

                  Through the implementation of a guided experience and a single
                  pane UX design, user satisfaction has increased by 20%
                  according to initial feedback.

                  between different departments resulting in faster
                  decision-making, saving 30 minutes per task on average.

                Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how
                CPQ works and the intricacies of the quoting and ordering
                process. I learned the importance of understanding and catering
                to the needs of various stakeholders, including sales reps,
                solution architects, and order managers.

                ability to work in a fast-paced environment with constantly
                changing requirements. It also taught me the value of
                collaboration and communication to ensure that everyone is on
                the same page and working towards a common goal. This experience
                has been invaluable to me in terms of professional growth and
                development.

                Implementing additional features: While we were able to
                implement several key features during the project, there are
                still some additional features that would be valuable to users.
                With more time, I would like to explore the possibility of
                implementing these features and continuing to iterate on the
                overall design.

                Conducting additional testing: While we conducted extensive
                feedback sessions throughout the project, there is always room
                for improvement when tested with actual users. With more time, I
                would like to conduct testing to ensure that the UX is as
                streamlined and user-friendly as possible.
